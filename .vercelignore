# Ignore Client (It is built separately or handled by root if needed, but for Function, we don't need source)
# Actually, Vercel builds client too. We need client source for frontend build, but NOT for backend function bundle?
# Vercel splits builds.
# Standard Vercel Ignore for Mixed Repos:
# We MUST include client source because Vercel builds it.
# BUT we must exclude `node_modules` and local artifacts.
